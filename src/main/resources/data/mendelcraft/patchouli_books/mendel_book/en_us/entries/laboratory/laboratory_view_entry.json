You can find these in every box next to a lab table. Right-clicking on the chicken and aiming with the syringe will draw its blood. This syringe can then be placed in the first (or second) slot of the lab."

If you click on one of them, two new rows will appear, representing the two DNA copies of each chromosome. You can see that these copies have multiple genes. Some show nothing when pressed, but this is because those genes are irrelevant to us in Mendelcraft. However, some of them show a sequence when selected, with 'T', 'A', 'C' and G. These are the four bases that make up all DNA and code for a trait of the chicken."

One strand comes from its father and the other from its mother. Those strands contain genes, and those genes define the color of the chicken. For the $(l)Black$() and $(l)White$() chickens, both strands have the $(l)Black$() or $(l)White$() gene respectively, while the $(l)Grey$() chickens have both $(l)Black$() and $(l)White$() genes."

Using this information we can make a \"square of Punnett\", which represents all possible gene combinations with the genes of the mother and father. This is a usefull tool to tell how high the change is for a child to have a certain characteristic."

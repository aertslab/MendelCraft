          "text": "The chickenâ€™s head colour is determined by gene 2 on chromosome 1. As you noticed, the chicken has a black or white head colour if the genes are the same on both chromosomes as in Experiment 2. However, when there are two different genes the head color is still white (instead of gray). So, there is something special going on with the genes here. The gene for getting a white head in a chicken must be present only once to ensure that the chicken gets a white head. We call such a gene dominant. The gene for getting a black head is called recessive and therefore has to occure twice to be expressed."

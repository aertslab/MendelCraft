After an egg is created, you can find it in the third slot of the lab's first tab. After that, you can change the genes in the last tab, where you also pressed the button to create the child. The layout is the same as for viewing the DNA, but now when you select a 'gene' you can browse gene possibilities. If there is a pencil, it is possible to modify the gene. After customizing, go back to the first tab and take the egg. Pressing your right mouse button with the egg in hand will make a chicken appear. Only do this in the places/cages provided for this purpose."
